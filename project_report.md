# **Introduction**
  The IFT 598 "Middleware Programming and Database Security" project team was charged with completing "Deliverable 2"; interpreting a given set of requirements into a relational database schema and Structured Query Language (sql) scripts to create the database, tables, attributes with corresponding data types and relationships that will serve as the database for the course project. The results of which yielded a relational diagrams, relational table with constraints, a spreadsheet table listing the data types for entity attributes and a sql script to implement the relational database.  
   The team chose to again, adhere closely to the provided requirements and continuing with the "IMPACT" volunteer organization. The team employed a methodical approach by first parsing the given requirements to determine the entities and attributes, including composite attributes and possible weak entities.  From here, the key attributes were identified and relations were developed to refine the initial diagrams. Once the Entity Relation (ER) diagram was created and included, entities, attributes, relations and constraints, the seven (7) step algorithm introduced in the course material was used to produce a relational mapping.  With the relational mapping and data types now depicting a complete schema, sql scripts were derived to construct the physical database.   Although there are many possible implementation paths the team could employ with the database design, the team used the requirements with little variation for the design.  Examples will be provided in the Description section of this report to highlight alternative design considerations while describing in detail the implementation of the requirements.  The User Manual section of this report will detail the required steps to take the provided code and implement it locally and the Conclusion section will focus on 5 keys areas of reflection and improvement.
